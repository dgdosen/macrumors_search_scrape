# macrumors_search_scrape
scrape your mac rumors search

# TODO

- Use Brave? a browser with a cookie alread set
- Navigate to macrumors
- Navigate to https://forums.macrumors.com/search/
- Fill in leman, deconstruct60, Unregistered 4U, mr_roboto
- Run the search
- Save the page to Reeder? If I start in Safari this can work (maybe not via API) but the saved page, or link viewed in Reeder is shite.

If anything, you'll be able to just read it in the browser... Just leave it
open.  How to trigger? Command line?
